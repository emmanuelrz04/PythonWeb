# PythonWeb

**A full-stack web application built with Python (Flask) on the backend and HTML/CSS on the frontend.**

Detailed documentation explaining every element of the code — both frontend and backend — will be available in the **"HowWork"** folder.

---

## Important Note

The application logic (in `app.py`) is currently documented through detailed comments within the code itself. This was done to make the development process clearer and easier to follow. Eventually, this documentation will be migrated to the "HowWork" folder.
